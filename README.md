The goal of the "Potential Leed Prediction" project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict potential leeds for a business based on various data inputs. A potential leed is defined as a person or company that has shown interest in the products or services offered by the business, but has not yet become a customer. By accurately identifying potential leeds, businesses can focus their marketing efforts on these individuals or organizations, increasing their chances of converting them into paying customers.

The project will involve several stages, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The data will be collected from various sources, including social media platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and other relevant data sources. The data will be preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or incomplete data, and the remaining data will be transformed and prepared for modeling.

 The model will be selected based on its ability to handle the specific characteristics of the data and the accuracy of its predictions. Various machine learning algorithms will be considered, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests

The model will be evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best-performing model will be selected and deployed for use in predicting potential leeds for the business.

The potential impact of this project is significant, as it can help businesses to identify and target potential leeds more effectively, leading to increased sales and revenue.

Overall, the "Potential Leed Prediction" project has the potential to provide valuable insights and benefits for businesses looking to increase their customer base and improve their marketing strategies.
